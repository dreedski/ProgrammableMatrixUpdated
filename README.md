# ProgrammableMatrixUpdated

Create a matrix that will hold single characters in its elements.

    Write a programmable character matrix class with these methods.  Use a 2-D array to hold your matrix.
        Constructor - Initializes the size of the matrix
        A method that gets a character from the matrix
        A method that sets a character in the matrix
        A method that clears an element in the matrix so that it is blank
        toString
            Returns the matrix as a string so it can be printed
            Build your own toString method
            Do NOT use any built-in methods that returns the array as a string
    Write a program using your class that will allow the user to put single characters into the elements of the matrix.
    Give the user these options.
        Create a new matrix - Replaces the matrix with a new blank one
        Set an element - Sets an element in the matrix to a single character
        Get an element - Gets an element from the matrix
        Empty an element - Resets an element so that it is blank
        Print the matrix from the toString method
        Quit - Quits the program
    You can create your options however you want.  For example:
        Create a menu.
            New matrix (press N)?
                How many rows?
                How many columns?
            Set an element (press S)?
                Row?
                Column?
                Character?
            Get an element (press G)?
                Row?
                Column?
            Empty an element (press E)
                Row?
                Column?
            Print the matrix (press P)
            Quit (press Q)
        Use commands - Examples
            n Rows Columns
                n 4 5
                Creates a new 4 x 5 matrix
            s Row Column Character
                s 2 3 A
                Sets the element at row 2, column 3 to the letter A
            g Row Column
                g 2 3
                Gets the element at row 2, column 3
            e Row Column
                e 2 3
                Resets the element at row 2, column 3 to blank
            p - Prints the matrix
            q - Quits the program
    Put the options in a loop so the user can put characters into the matrix.

 

Notes

    Be sure your class works with matrices of any size.
    Do not procrastinate.
    It is not hard, but long.
    You can test your program by creating letters of the alphabet with your matrix.
    This will be extended in the next program.
